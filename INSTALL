After pulling the OpenRA source, the first thing you’ll need to do is to make sure the Ijw.DirectX 
submodule is updated and the Ijw.Framework submodule inside the Ijw.DirectX submodule is updated as well. 
The Ijw.Framework submodule should be built in both release and debug modes and requires NUnit 
(http://www.nunit.org/index.php) to build unless the IjwFrameworkTests project is unloaded.

After the Ijw.Framework submodule is built, the Ijw.DirectX submodule should be built as well. After that 
you should be all good to go ahead and build OpenRA.

To run OpenRA, several files from the original game’s install need to be copied to the root of the project 
directory. These are "redalert.mix", "conquer.mix", "temperat.mix", "interior.mix" and "snow.mix".

Red Alert has been released by EA Games as freeware so it shouldn’t be too hard to find a legal copy of the 
CD images. Unfortunately the installer is 16-bit and so won’t run on modern 64-bit operating systems. This 
can be worked around by using the Red Alert Setup Manager (http://ra.afraid.org/html/downloads/utilities-3.html). 
Make sure you apply the no-CD protection fix so all the files needed are installed to the hard drive.
