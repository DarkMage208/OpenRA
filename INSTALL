To run OpenRA, several files are needed from the original game disks.

The required files for the Red Alert mod are:
EITHER:
	* conquer.mix
	* temperat.mix
	* interior.mix
	* snow.mix
	* sounds.mix
	* allies.mix
	* russian.mix
OR:
	* main.mix
AND:
	* redalert.mix

These need to be copied into the mods/ra/packages/ directory.


The required files for the Command and Conquer mod are:
	* cclocal.mix
	* speech.mix
	* conquer.mix
	* sounds.mix
	* tempicnh.mix
	* temperat.mix
	* winter.mix
	* desert.mix

These need to be copied into the mods/cnc/packages/ directory.
If you have a case-sensitive filesystem you must change the filenames to
lower case.


Red Alert and C&C have been released by EA Games as freeware. They can be
downloaded from http://www.commandandconquer.com/classic
Unfortunately the installer is 16-bit and so wonâ€™t run on 64-bit operating
systems. This can be worked around by using the Red Alert Setup Manager 
	(http://ra.afraid.org/html/downloads/utilities-3.html). 
Make sure you apply the no-CD protection fix so all the files needed 
are installed to the hard drive.

Dependencies - Make sure you have these installed, or you'll 
have very strange errors.
