This file is part of OpenRA, which is free software. It is made 
available to you under the terms of the GNU General Public License

see COPYING.

To run OpenRA, several files are needed from the original game disks.
These files are now downloaded and installed by the game,
so so no explicit action is required.

Dependencies - Make sure you have these installed, or you'll 
have very strange errors.

WINDOWS:

* .NET Framework >= 3.5-SP1
	(http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=AB99342F-5D1A-413D-8319-81DA479AB0D7&displaylang=en)
* Tao Framework >= 2.1.0
	This is now bundled with OpenRA, copy the files in thirdparty/Tao to the game root directory.
* OpenAL >= 1.1
	(http://connect.creativelabs.com/openal/Downloads/oalinst.zip)
* Cg Toolkit >= 2.2
	(http://developer.download.nvidia.com/cg/Cg_2.2/Cg-2.2_October2009_Setup.exe)

To compile OpenRA, open the OpenRA.sln solution in the main folder, 
or build it from the command-line with MSBuild.

Run the game with `OpenRA.Game.exe Game.Mods=ra` for Red Alert
or `OpenRA.Game.exe Game.Mods=cnc` for Command & Conquer


UBUNTU (substitute comparable packages for other linux distros):
* mono-runtime (>= 2.6.7),
* mono-gmcs
* freetype
* libmono-corlib1.0-cil
* libmono-winforms2.0-cil
* libopenal1
* libsdl1.2-dev
* nvidia-cg-toolkit (download the latest version from
  http://developer.nvidia.com/object/cg_download.html)

OpenRA is incompatible with Compiz, please disable desktop effects when trying
to run OpenRA or the game will crash.

You will additionally need to copy the third party dependencies (.dll and .config) from the
thirdparty and thirdparty/Tao directories into the game root:

	cp -v thirdparty/*.dll thirdparty/Tao/* .

Alternatively, the dlls can be installed into your system GAC. This is not
recommended because we ship a custom Tao.FreeType that can conflict with
other applications that use Tao:

	gacutil -i thirdparty/Tao/Tao.Cg.dll
	gacutil -i thirdparty/Tao/Tao.OpenGl.dll
	gacutil -i thirdparty/Tao/Tao.OpenAl.dll
	gacutil -i thirdparty/Tao/Tao.Sdl.dll
	gacutil -i thirdparty/Tao/Tao.FreeType.dll
	gacutil -i thirdparty/ICSharpCode.SharpZipLib.dll

To compile OpenRA, run `make' from the command line.
Run the game with `mono OpenRA.Game.exe Game.Mods=ra` for Red Alert
or `mono OpenRA.Game.exe Game.Mods=cnc` for Command & Conquer
