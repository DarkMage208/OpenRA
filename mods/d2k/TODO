# make R8Reader not always scan the whole file on load
# brick walls don't fit, requires updated RenderBuildingWall
# factories and refinery require overlays (something like RenderWeaponFactory)
# make structures appear earlier when errecting from ground
# silo frames don't fit, requires updated RenderSilo
# harvester unload frames missing (too few DATA.R8 frames in general)
# carryalls should automatically transport harvesters (needs complex logic)
# windtrap animations missing
# outpost animations missing
# construction yard crane animations missing
# Arrakis tileset crashes the game
# create a tileset extractor for gamefiles to remove copyrighted content from distribution
# replace ore with spice and mines with spice blooms
# add game logic for concrete plates
# allow placing turrets on walls
# support separate turret sequence with RenderBuildingTurreted
# repair bay should repair vehicles
# add ornithocopter (might need new RenderOrni code)
# add infantry
# add tanks
# add sandworm
# add thumper
# allow upgrades
# add ordos/harkonnen (avoid redundancy using inheritances)
# add voices (Dune 2000/DATA/SFX folder contains .aud files)
# muzzles and explosions with lightning (might need engine update)
# ingame gamefile extractor at first start when SHPs are not found
# create a shellmap
# rework chrome UI, dialoges, tabs
# add install rules to makefile (once more polished)
# idea: frame 2998 (looks like hole) could become a tunnel to make Ordos really insidious (similiar mechanism to paratroopers powerproxy)
