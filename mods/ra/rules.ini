; ******* Warhead Characteristics *******
; This is what gives the "rock, paper, scissors" character to the game.
; It describes how the damage is to be applied to the target. The
; values should take into consideration the 'area of effect'.
; example: Although an armor piercing tank round would instantly
; kill a soldier IF it hit, the anti-infantry rating is still
; very low because the tank round has such a limited area of
; effect, lacks pinpoint accuracy, and acknowledges the fact that
; tanks pose little threat to infantry that take cover.

; Spread = damage spread factor [larger means greater spread] (def=1)
;          [A value of 1 means the damage is halved every pixel distant from center point.
;          a value of 2 means damage is halved every 2 pixels, etc.]
; Wall = Does this warhead damage concrete walls (def=no)?
; Wood = Does this warhead damage wood walls (def=no)?
; Ore = Does this warhead destroy ore (def=no)?
; Verses = damage value verses various armor types (as percentage of full damage)...
;           -vs- none, wood (buildings), light armor, heavy armor, concrete
; Explosion = which explosion set to use when warhead of this type impacts (def=0)
;             0=none, 1=piff, 2=piffs, 3=fire, 4=frags, 5=pops, 6=nuke
