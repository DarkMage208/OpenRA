		this file describes animation sequences for structures and units.
		
		<sequence src=...> can be used to override the choice of .shp file
		used to extract a sequence. if it is not present, the .shp matching
		the unit name is used instead.
		
		either of <sequence length=...> or <sequence end=...> are
		recognized; if neither is present, a 1-frame sequence is assumed
		
		also, <sequence length="*"> creates a sequence that includes all frames
		after `start`.
		
		one day, we might support inheritance here too.
		
		standard sequence names:
			idle		- doing nothing
			make		- deploy (sell is `make` played backwards)
			build		- production building doing something
			
			damaged-idle	- doing nothing while on yellow health (or worse)
			damaged-build	- production while on yellow health
