OpenRA is a Libre/Free Real Time Strategy game engine supporting early Westwood games like Command & Conquer and Command & Conquer: Red Alert.

Distributed mods include a reimagining and updating of both the Red Alert and Command & Conquer multiplayer games. This repository tries to add Dune 2000. It is already a standalone mod, but still falls back to Red Alert gamefiles at some times.

Please read INSTALL on how to install an OpenRA development environment, HACKING for an overview of the engine and mods/d2k/TODO to find out about the still missing features. You need to copy "Dune 2000/Data/GAMESFX" and "Dune 2000/DATA/DATA.R8" to ~/.openra/Content/d2k/ and run the bash script ripD2kGameFiles.sh before starting the d2k mod.
